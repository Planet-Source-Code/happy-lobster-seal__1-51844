<br>
<b>
Arithmetic</b><br>
<br>
These instructions perform arithmetic operations in the ALU.  After an instruction has been evaluated, the result remains in the register (apart from the non destructive Cmpr) and the flag register is set.  The flag register stores whether the result of the last arithmetic instruction was positive, negative or zero.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>
Internal Data Transfer</b><br>
<br>
These instructions move data from memory to registers and vice versa.<br>
<br>
<b>
External Data Transfer</b><br>
<br>
These instructions are used to send and retrieve data from external devices such as the keyboard and screen.<br>
<br>
<b>
Branching</b><br>
<br>
These instructions control the flow of program execution and allow jumps to other parts.  They can be conditional (dependant on the flag register) or unconditional (will always jump).  Subroutines are called by using Jsubr and Exit to return.</font><br>
